# Manual Delivery Assignment Flow Plan

## Goal

Current requirement:

1. User places order.
2. Order goes to restaurant.
3. Restaurant accepts order.
4. Restaurant prepares food.
5. Restaurant clicks `Mark as Ready`.
6. After `Mark as Ready`, order should go to admin for delivery-boy assignment.
7. Delivery boy must **not** be auto-assigned.
8. Admin should manually choose which delivery boy gets the order.
9. The selected delivery boy should receive the assignment request.
10. Admin side should also have a `Resend` button similar to the restaurant resend action.

## Expected Final Flow

### Stage 1: Order Creation

- User places order.
- Backend creates order with:
  - `orderStatus = created`
  - `dispatch.status = unassigned`
  - `dispatch.modeAtCreation = manual`
- Order notification goes only to restaurant.

### Stage 2: Restaurant Accepts

- Restaurant clicks `Accept`.
- Order status changes to `confirmed` or `preparing`.
- At this stage:
  - no delivery partner broadcast
  - no auto-assign
  - no rider notification
- Order remains only in restaurant processing flow.

### Stage 3: Restaurant Marks Ready

- Restaurant clicks `Mark as Ready`.
- Order status changes to `ready_for_pickup`.
- Backend should create/admin-trigger a manual dispatch request state.
- Admin should receive:
  - notification
  - order visible in admin manual-assignment queue
- Still:
  - no rider auto assignment
  - no public rider broadcast

### Stage 4: Admin Assigns Delivery Boy

- Admin opens pending ready orders.
- Admin selects one delivery boy manually.
- Backend updates:
  - `dispatch.status = assigned`
  - `dispatch.deliveryPartnerId = selected rider id`
  - `dispatch.assignedAt = now`
- Only that selected delivery boy receives:
  - socket event
  - push notification
  - assignment request/order card

### Stage 5: Admin Resend

- If assigned rider did not respond or missed the notification:
  - admin can click `Resend`
- Resend should:
  - send notification again only to currently assigned rider
  - not auto-pick another rider
  - not broadcast to all riders

## Required Behavior Change

### Remove / Stop

- Auto assignment when restaurant accepts order.
- Auto search for nearby riders on `confirmed` / `preparing`.
- Auto broadcast to delivery partners before admin action.
- Any forced global dispatch mode returning `auto`.

### Keep

- Restaurant receives new order as before.
- Restaurant can accept and mark ready as before.
- Existing delivery acceptance flow can continue after admin manually assigns rider.

## Suggested Backend Logic

### Order lifecycle rules

- `created` -> restaurant sees order
- `preparing` -> restaurant working, dispatch still pending manual admin action
- `ready_for_pickup` -> admin assignment required
- `assigned` -> selected delivery boy notified
- `accepted` -> delivery boy accepted assignment

### New/clear dispatch intent

Recommended meaning:

- `dispatch.modeAtCreation = manual`
- `dispatch.status = unassigned` means rider not chosen yet
- admin queue filter should mainly show:
  - `orderStatus = ready_for_pickup`
  - `dispatch.status = unassigned`

Optional extra field if needed for clarity:

- `dispatch.adminActionRequired = true/false`

This is optional because `ready_for_pickup + unassigned` may already be enough.

## Backend Files Likely Affected

### 1. `Backend/src/modules/food/orders/services/order.service.js`

Main change area.

- Stop rider notification/broadcast on restaurant accept.
- On `ready_for_pickup`, notify admin instead of riders.
- Manual assign function should notify selected delivery boy properly.
- Add resend function for admin-assigned rider.

### 2. `Backend/src/modules/food/orders/services/order-dispatch.service.js`

- Remove/disable forced auto mode behavior.
- Ensure settings do not override manual requirement.
- Prevent automatic retry/broadcast flow from running for this food order flow.

### 3. `Backend/src/modules/food/orders/controllers/order.controller.js`

- Add controller for admin resend if missing.
- Keep existing restaurant resend separate if still needed.

### 4. `Backend/src/modules/food/admin/routes/admin.routes.js`

Likely add routes like:

- `POST /food/admin/orders/:orderId/assign-delivery`
- `POST /food/admin/orders/:orderId/resend-delivery-notification`

If assign route already exists, it should be completed and exposed properly.

### 5. `Backend/src/modules/food/orders/models/order.model.js`

- Mostly already supports manual mode.
- May only need small cleanup if dispatch fields are enough already.

## Frontend Admin Plan

### Admin queue screen

Admin should have a page/table for:

- ready orders waiting for delivery assignment
- assigned orders
- resend action

Recommended statuses for UI:

- `Ready for Assignment`
- `Assigned`
- `Accepted by Delivery Boy`

### Admin actions needed

- view order
- choose delivery boy
- assign
- resend

## Frontend Files Likely Affected

### 1. `Frontend/src/services/api/index.js`

- Add missing admin APIs:
  - assign delivery partner
  - resend delivery notification from admin
- Keep restaurant resend API separate.

### 2. `Frontend/src/modules/Food/pages/admin/OrderDetectDelivery.jsx`

- Show orders that are `ready_for_pickup` and unassigned.
- Add clear status for pending admin action.

### 3. `Frontend/src/modules/Food/components/admin/orders/OrderDetectDeliveryTable.jsx`

- Add action buttons:
  - `Assign`
  - `Resend`
  - `View`

### 4. `Frontend/src/modules/Food/components/admin/orders/ViewOrderDetectDeliveryDialog.jsx`

- Add rider assignment UI or connect to a separate assign modal.
- Show current dispatch info.

### 5. Delivery partner UI

- No major behavior change needed except:
  - rider should only receive order after admin assignment
  - no early broadcast before admin choice

## Notification Plan

### Restaurant

- New order notification only.

### Admin

- Notify when restaurant marks order ready.
- Message example:
  - `Order FOD-XXXXXX is ready. Please assign a delivery boy.`

### Delivery Boy

- Notify only after admin manually assigns.
- Resend should target only assigned rider.

## API / Action Summary

### Restaurant side

- `Accept order`
- `Mark as ready`

### Admin side

- `Get ready orders pending assignment`
- `Assign delivery boy`
- `Resend assignment notification`

### Delivery side

- `Accept assigned order`

## Edge Cases

### If restaurant marks ready but admin does not assign yet

- Order stays in admin pending queue.
- No rider sees it.

### If admin assigns wrong rider

- Later enhancement can support:
  - reassign
  - cancel current assignment

### If assigned rider does not respond

- Admin uses resend.
- If needed later, admin can change rider manually.

## Implementation Order

1. Fix backend flow so no rider auto notification happens on restaurant accept.
2. Trigger admin notification when restaurant clicks ready.
3. Complete admin manual assign API.
4. Add admin resend API.
5. Update admin UI to show `ready_for_pickup` waiting orders.
6. Add assign and resend buttons in admin UI.
7. Verify selected rider alone receives assignment.

## Success Criteria

This feature is complete when:

1. Restaurant accept does not assign or notify riders automatically.
2. Restaurant `Mark as Ready` sends the order to admin queue.
3. Admin can manually choose one delivery boy.
4. Only selected delivery boy gets the order request.
5. Admin can resend the assignment request.
6. No auto assignment happens anywhere in the flow.
